This repo contains the code to flash to the steering wheel, see main.py (use [this vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterStaev.lego-spikeprime-mindstorms-vscode) when flashing), aswell as the windows driver.

When running the windows driver, make sure you have node.js and python installed. Also run 'npm install' and 'pip install vgamepad' in the driver directory.
